    _Want to edit your data? Not now, at least._
    _Once in the future, you will also be able to view your records in much visualised way. Not now, at least._

### Timer
####    Once entered

    As we don't know how long you want the timer to run, please enter an interval to get your timer running. (This will be shown as a task with name "untitled" in home page)
    _You may insert a name for this unnamed record afterwards, when the EDIT feature comes out. Not now, at least._
